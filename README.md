## General Information

### _Fraud is Everywhere!_

Unfortunately, fraud comes in multiple forms and is found in various technology.  This is where I come in to help.  The three main tasks for this project are:

    1. Data Modeling: Define a database model to store the credit card transactions data and create a new PostgreSQL database using your model.

    2. Create a database schema on PostgreSQL and populate your database from the CSV files provided.

    3. Analyze the data to identify possible fraudulent transactions.
